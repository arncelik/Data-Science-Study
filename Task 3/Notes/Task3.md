# TASK 3
In this task, you are asked to implement "Convolution", and "Pooling" steps of a convnets. Basically, convolution; sliding window on an image channel to extract features about the image, and pooling is the step of reducing calculation cost on a layer of a neural net and reducing the complexity of this layer to present features more robust.

So, you will write two functions and each function's inputs are kernel info and image object. The output is convoluted or pooled version of the image object.
